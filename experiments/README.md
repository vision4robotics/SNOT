This fold contains totally 19 famous and recent Siamese trackers with different backbone networks, namely DaSiamRPN, LightTrack, Ocean, SE-SiamFC, SiamAPN, SiamAPN++, SiamBAN, SiamCAR, SiamDW (SiamFC+_CR, SiamFC+_CI, SiamFC+_CX, and SiamRPN+_CR), SiamFC++, SiamGAT, SiamMASK, SiamRPN++ (SiamRPN++_A, SiamRPN++_M, and SiamRPN++_R), and UpdateNet.

This models and codes are all from the official code library given by the authors. We have just modified and integrated their codes for convenient running on the benchmarks. All of the trackers evaluated have maintained a set of their parameters.
